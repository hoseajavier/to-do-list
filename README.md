# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple **To-Do List application** built with **React**.  
This app allows users to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks.  
All tasks are stored in **LocalStorage**, so your data will still be available even after refreshing the page.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [flowtasks.vercel.app](https://flowtasks.vercel.app)
